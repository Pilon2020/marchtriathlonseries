      <p align="left">   The March Triathlon Series is the longest running
        collegiate triathlon in the West Coast. The event started as a senior
        project in 1998 and was held on campus at Cal Poly. Race participants
        joined from Cal Poly, Santa Barbara, and Cal Berkeley with a total of 15
        racers. The spring race served as a warm up for Wildflower, which was
        the collegiate national championship race. Eventually, the race grew and
        moved to Lake Lopez, Arroyo Grande in 2004, where it transformed into
        the March Triathlon Series. <br>
        <br>
         The first race included an 800 yard pool swim, 23 mile bike along Hwy
        1, and a 6 mile run through the agricultural fields at Cal Poly. Now,
        the race includes a Sprint distance with an 800 yard swim, 12.3 mile
        bike, and a 3.1 mile run, and an Olympic distance with a 1500 meter
        swim, 24.7 mile bike, and a 6.2 mile run. <br>
        <br>
         Although it has changed a lot from its humble beginnings, the mission
        of MTS has always been to produce a competitive sporting event, which
        promotes athletic excellence, sportsmanship, and a love for the sport,
        while providing a safe and supportive environment for athletes of all
        skill levels, whether age-group or collegiate. <br>
        <br>
         MTS is proudly hosted by the Cal Poly Triathlon Team. All proceeds from
        the event help provide our athletes low-cost club team membership,
        affordable gear, as well as discounted race entries and travel fees to
        collegiate races throughout California and to Collegiate Nationals. </p>
